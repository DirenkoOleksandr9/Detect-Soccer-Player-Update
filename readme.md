# ⚽ Soccer Player Highlight Reel Generator

An end-to-end AI pipeline that automatically generates personalized highlight reels for soccer players from full-length match videos.

## 🚀 Features

- **Player Detection**: YOLOv8-nano for robust player and ball detection
- **Multi-Object Tracking**: ByteTrack with Kalman filtering for smooth tracking
- **Long-term Re-Identification**: Hybrid system combining jersey number OCR and appearance embeddings
- **Event Detection**: SlowFast networks for action recognition (goals, shots, passes, tackles)
- **Video Assembly**: Intelligent clip extraction and stitching using PySceneDetect and FFmpeg

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)
- FFmpeg installed
- 8GB+ RAM

## 🛠️ Installation

### Local Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd soccer-highlight-pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Google Colab Setup

```python
!git clone <repository-url>
%cd soccer-highlight-pipeline
!python colab_setup.py
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Full Pipeline

```bash
python main_pipeline.py 9.mp4 --player-id 1 --output-dir output
```

### Stage-by-Stage Processing

```bash
# Stage 1: Player Detection
python main_pipeline.py 9.mp4 --stage detection

# Stage 2: Tracking (requires detections.json)
python main_pipeline.py 9.mp4 --stage tracking --detections output/detections.json

# Stage 3-5: Full pipeline from tracking
python main_pipeline.py 9.mp4 --player-id 1
```

## 📁 Output Structure

## 🔧 Configuration

### Player Detection
- Model: YOLOv8-nano (default) or custom trained model
- Confidence threshold: 0.4
- Minimum detection size: 30x50 pixels

### Tracking
- Algorithm: ByteTrack with Kalman filtering
- Track buffer: 30 frames
- Matching threshold: 0.8

### Re-Identification
- Similarity threshold: 0.7
- Jersey number bonus: 0.3
- Maximum distance: 300 pixels

### Event Detection
- Model: Custom SlowFast network
- Event classes: goal, shot, pass, tackle, normal
- Confidence threshold: 0.6

## 🎬 Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Player Detection
- Processes video frame-by-frame
- Detects players and ball using YOLOv8
- Outputs bounding boxes and confidence scores

### Stage 2: Short-term Tracking
- Links detections across consecutive frames
- Uses ByteTrack algorithm with Kalman filtering
- Maintains temporary track IDs

### Stage 3: Long-term Re-Identification
- Combines jersey number OCR with appearance features
- Assigns permanent player IDs across the entire video
- Handles occlusions and re-entries

### Stage 4: Event Detection
- Analyzes video clips for soccer actions
- Uses SlowFast networks for temporal understanding
- Filters events for target player

### Stage 5: Video Assembly
- Extracts clips around detected events
- Uses PySceneDetect for natural scene boundaries
- Stitches clips into final highlight reel

## 🏆 Performance

- **Speed**: ~30 FPS on RTX 3060
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ player tracking accuracy
- **Memory**: ~4GB GPU memory usage
- **Output**: 5-minute highlight reels

## 🔍 Advanced Usage

### Custom Model Training

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Train on SoccerNet dataset
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')
model.train(data='soccernet.yaml', epochs=100, imgsz=640)
```

### Multiple Player Tracking

```bash
# Generate highlights for multiple players
for player_id in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    python main_pipeline.py 9.mp4 --player-id $player_id
```

### Batch Processing

```bash
# Process multiple videos
for video in *.mp4; do
    python main_pipeline.py "$video" --player-id 1
done
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA out of memory**: Reduce batch size or use CPU
2. **FFmpeg not found**: Install FFmpeg system-wide
3. **OCR failures**: Adjust image preprocessing parameters
4. **Poor tracking**: Fine-tune similarity thresholds

### Performance Optimization

- Use GPU acceleration when available
- Process videos in chunks for large files
- Adjust confidence thresholds based on video quality
- Use smaller models for faster processing
