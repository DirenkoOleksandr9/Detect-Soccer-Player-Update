    "# âš½ Soccer Player Highlight Reel Generator - Production Grade\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a complete, production-grade, end-to-end pipeline for generating personalized soccer player highlight reels. This is an advanced version with sophisticated algorithms for each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸš€ Advanced Features\n",
    "- **Player Detection**: High-performance YOLOv8 for person detection.\n",
    "- **Multi-Object Tracking**: Full implementation of **ByteTrack** with a **Kalman Filter** for motion prediction and Hungarian Algorithm for association.\n",
    "- **Long-term Re-Identification**: A hybrid system using a **Deep CNN** for appearance embeddings combined with color histograms and Jersey OCR.\n",
    "- **Intelligent Event Detection**: A sophisticated heuristic model that analyzes player velocity, goal proximity, and clustering to identify key moments.\n",
    "- **Professional Video Assembly**: Integration of **PySceneDetect** to find natural scene boundaries for clean clip extraction, stitched with FFmpeg.\n",
    "\n",
    "## âš¡ How to Use\n",
    "1. **Enable GPU**: Go to \`Runtime\` â†’ \`Change runtime type\` and select \`T4 GPU\`.\n",
    "2. **Run All Cells**: Click \`Runtime\` â†’ \`Run all\`.\n",
    "3. **Upload Video**: An upload prompt will appear. Select your soccer match video.\n",
    "4. **Wait**: The pipeline will process the video. This is a computationally intensive process.\n",
    "5. **Download**: The final highlight reel and data files will be automatically downloaded."
